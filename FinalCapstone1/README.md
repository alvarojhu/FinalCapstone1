# Using Machine Learning to Predict NBA Players' Salaries
Capstone Project 1 for Springboard

### Project Description
This project was made with this question for General Managers of the NBA in mind: "Is X player worth Y amount of money?"
Almost every season, the GM of a basketball team needs to make very important decisions when it comes to signing players, and the 
biggest decision is how much money the team should pay them. 

### Methodology
In this project, I use several datasets from basketball-reference.com to answer this question. Utilizing the Pandas module in Python,
I clean and wrangle the data. I then visualized the data to find any obvious trends in the data. For this I used the Seaborn module in
Python. After figuring out which features were important to the salary, I used various machine learning algorithms to try and yield and 
accurate prediction of the player's salary based on their stats from the previous year.
